# FootballAnalysis
This project is born out of my love for football. It aims to use computer vision to detect players and analyze their performance, speed and total distance covered during games in addition to the performance of the entire team. 
Additionally, I plan to include handy tools like offside detection and a system to determine possession when the ball goes out of play (corner vs. goal kick).

# Data Collection
This model will be trained on the DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout dataset (found here on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/overview), and is aimed to be applicable for any wide-lense video footage.
